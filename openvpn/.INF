This is the default directory for OpenVPN Files
Ovpnc and OpenVPN should both have access.
By default OpenVPN will cd to here after startup.

* CHROOT:
You can create a chroot as a subdirectory called jail
or chroot.

- exec -
You need to make sure all the files are accessible
for OpenVPN after it starts up. Files like 'crl.pem'
and client configuration scripts, start-up script,
client-connect scripts etc, must be present and 
accessible within the chroot.

- lib -
You should also copy /lib into the chroot, in case
needed you can create a softlink 'ln -s lib lib64'

- env -
When 'env' is used it should be copied from '/usr/bin'
to an accessible bin directory within the chroot.
If you are using 'md5sum' or any other tool then 
you should also copy them into the chroot.

- keys -

Generally, server keys should be out of the chroot,
so does the ta.key, they are all read by openvpn
before it enters into the chroot.
