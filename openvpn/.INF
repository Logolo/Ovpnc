This is the default directory for OpenVPN Files
Ovpnc and OpenVPN should both have access.
By default OpenVPN will cd to here after startup.

* CHROOT:
You can create a chroot from this directory
or create a subdirectory called jail or chroot.
You need to make sure all the files are accessible
for OpenVPN after it starts up. Files like crl.pem
and client configuration scripts, start-up script
must be present and accessible within the chroot.
You should also copy /lib into the chroot, in case
needed you can create a softlink ln -s lib lib64
